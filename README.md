This pan-cancer project involved analyses of chromosome arm aneuploidies (CAAs) in cancer development. The study of CAAs 
revealed novel aspects of tumour evolution, metastasis, patient survival outcome, and chemotherapeutic drug response for a 
broad range of cancers.

This folder contains data files and Python and R scripts used in the study.
